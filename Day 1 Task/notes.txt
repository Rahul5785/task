1.HPPT1.1 vs HPPT 2

   HTTP_HYPERTEXT TRANSFER protocal, is basics for all method  of computer 
   and server get request and send information to clients. the first usable
   version of HTTP was created in 1997 called HTTP1.1 .it is still in use 
   of web. in 2015, a new version of HTTP callEd HTTP2 was created. 

   HTTP 2 solves several problems that created in HTTP1.1 . HTTP2 is much faster 
   than HTTP1.1. HTTP1.1 loads a single request for every TCP connections, while 
   HTTP 2 aviod network delay by multiplexing(mulitiple stream of data at once.)

   HTTP 1.1 introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about 
   status of a message that defines 24 staus code error reporting id quciker and efficent 
   HTTP 2 underlying semantics of HTTP suc as header status code remains same.
    
    server push-server only servers content if client will ask of it. if the client
    will request several dozens of content it will not possible. to over come this 
    problem in HTTP 2 by allowing server to 'push' the content to clients before 
    they ask.

    Header compression small files load more qucikly than larger one. for that both 
    HTTP1.1 & HTTP 2 compress HTTP messade to smaller.HTTP 2 use advance method redundant 
    information in HTTP header packet.  


    2. OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION

       objects are important data types in javascript.objects are different than primitive
       data type primitive data type contain one data type value but object contais many
       value in form of Key:Value pair. these keys can be variable or function amd has some 
       values associated with propertie.

       EX 

           var a={
                  name:"vijay"
                  age:"48"
                  year:"1974"
           };

           Here name,age,and year keys and vijay, 48, 1974 are the values of key .Each
           of the key represented as properties.
